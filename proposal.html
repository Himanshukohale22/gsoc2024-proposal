Project
********

**Project name:** librobotcontrol support for newer boards (AI,AI-64 and BeagleV-Fire).

Description
============

Librobotcontrol is package of C library which contains examples and testing programs for Robotic control projects used by `robotic cape&lt;https://www.beagleboard.org/boards/beaglebone-robotics-cape&gt;_` which is sold by beagleboard.org,
which supports the BBB and AI thanks to Deepak khatri who Previouly worked upon cape compatibility on BBB. 
There are many capes beagleboard sold with compatibility for beagleboards but with robotic cape only BBB and AI support the librobotcontrol packages, we need to refine the device trees overlays to use this librobotcontrol package with AI-64 and BeagleV-Fire. 
The main goal for this projects is to Update librobotcontrol for Robotics Cape on BeagleBone AI, BeagleBone AI-64 and BeagleV-Fire.
customized device tree can be programmed with dtsi files to examine the process and how device tree works with AI-64 and beaeglV-fire, Flattend device tree are to be updated according to hardware implementations with boards.
various pheripherals to be updated for various sensors, motors and satellite modules are  to be used with newer bords.

- I2C 
- SPI 
- UART 
- GPIO 

previous work:-

previously Deepak khatri who worded upon the cape compatibility for beagleboards. use the robotic cape for various tasks. 
using pre-work upon robotic cape, i can take a deep dive to robotic cape compatibility with beagleboard and how its works.
In previous gsoc-2022 participation kai yamada work upon same project which was about robotic-cape support with BeaglBboneBlack(BBB) and beaglebone-AI.
he implemented the device tree overlayes for BBB and AI for specific pheripherals to enabling functionality of pwm, communication pheripherals like i2c and spi and uart for robotic capes. 

problem and solution:

There are no device tree overlayes for beagleV-fire beagleboard to use with robotic capes.
first thing to do is to creat device tree overlayes for beagleV-fire using reference as `BeaglBboneBlack(BBB) device tree overlayes&lt;https://github.com/beagleboard/librobotcontrol/blob/master/device_tree/dtb-4.14-ti/am335x-bone-common-universal-pins.dtsi&gt;_`
also there are some examples available to customized use of `device trees with relay capes&lt;https://www.beagleboard.org/blog/2022-02-15-using-device-tree-overlays-example-on-beaglebone-cape-add-on-boards&gt;_` which can be very useful during deep understand and functionality of board.



Software
=========

- Device tree's overlays for beagleboards will be used here.
- Primarily VScode and gitlab with web-IDE is use in this project for deep dive into code and firmware of librobotcontrol and rc (robot control library) examples.
- Eclipes IDE can be used for starting phase of project.
- C language.

- Beaglebone Black
- BeagleBone AI 
- Beaglebone AI 64
- BeagleV-fire
- Beaglebone-capes
   - Robotic cape
   - Relay cape

Experience and approch
***********************

Experience: 
    • I’m well experienced with embedded system and C . I’ve in-hand experienced with embedded programming and hardware design for various boards and projects.
    • Below are some projects which are about embedded system and robotics.
    1. `Martian rover used in  IRC (International rover challenge ) &lt;https://github.com/vishwaspace&gt;`_
    2. `STM32 custom board &lt;https://github.com/Himanshukohale22/stm32-custom-board-v1.2&gt;`_
    3. `Vaayu – AQI and various concentration calculation for gases present in air &lt;https://github.com/Himanshukohale22/FYP_GreenSpace&gt;`_ 
    4. `TVC rocketry – Thrust vector control &lt;https://github.com/Himanshukohale22/CYRUS&gt;`_
	
	More projects done by me can be found on my `github &lt;https://github.com/Himanshukohale22&gt;`_
    • I’ve designed various double and four layer board for clients and projects  using  Kicad , Eagle and Altium designer `(Designs) &lt;github/Himanshu/my_designs&gt;`_. And this shows that I’ve very good understanding for reading schematics and Circuit design for embedded development, which is required for This project. 

Approach:

In my experience, projects often demand a comprehensive understanding of both software and hardware components Before changing the  main packages, Hardware setup and debug will required more time than software. This involves meticulous reading of documentation and references, demanding patience and focus. I believe that this content can be completed without any problems.

Contingency
===========

What will you do if you get stuck on your project and your mentor isn’t around?

Unexpected software and hardware problems are most common in any projects. In such cases,

1. In the event of encountering compatibility issues between BeagleBoard and librobotcontrol, I'll to use the BeagleBone Black (BBB) platform for testing purposes, as BBB offers native support for the librobotcontrol package.
2. If there is any hardware related issue to board,first ill review the datasheets and manule of hardware and if there is any issue related to circuitry I’ll use oscilloscope, multimeter and other testing devices for debugging.
3. If the problem is about SOC, I’ll check the datasheets of perticular SOC.

Benefit
========

If successfully completed, what will its impact be on the `BeagleBoard.org &lt;https://www.beagleboard.org/&gt;`_ community? Include quotes from `BeagleBoard.org &lt;https://www.beagleboard.org/&gt;`_.
community members who can be found on our `Discord &lt;https://bbb.io/gsocchat&gt;`_ and `BeagleBoard.org forum &lt;https://bbb.io/gsocml/13&gt;`_.
 
* Librobotcontrol packages will support the beaglebone-AI, beaglebone-AI 64 and BeagleV-fire. 
* Various tutorials, Documentation will be added to the Robotic Capes to help the user understand how to use it using llibrobotcotrol packages.

Misc
====

Please complete the requirements listed in the `General Requirements &lt;https://gsoc.beagleboard.io/guides/contributor#general-requirements&gt;`_ . Provide link to merge request.

- All prerequisite tasks have been completed.
 * Source dive for Librobotcontrol packages and read all the documentation for packages
 * Check hardware specification, setup and device trees for BBB.
 * Here the 'Hello world' task Pull request : `merge request &lt;https://github.com/jadonk/gsoc-application/pull/191&gt;`_
